# Play By Ear [WIP]
Trying out a custom vanilla javascript project--from ux design to implementation!

## Phase One - Design
I'll be following the principle of [Content First Design](https://blog.prototypr.io/content-first-design-second-prototyping-with-words-and-adobe-xd-c4c07cac21ef). That means I'll focus on my content first, and then design _around_ it.

### 1. Storyframe
Write your interface out like it's a story that will eventually guide users to an end goal. This story will act as your proto-content--the content for your prototype.

### 2. Sketch with Words
Using the story created in step one, sketch a layout. Map fields from your proto-content to elements in the user interface. That way, you can determine if illustrations are needed, how much space certain elements will take up, and more.

### 3. XD it!
Import the proto-content into Adobe XD to build the first iteration of your low-fidelity prototype. 

## Phase Two - Development
